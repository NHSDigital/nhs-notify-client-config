# Event Catalogue

SERVER MODE

`make dev`
`http://localhost:3000/docs`

STATIC MODE

Open in "General" dev container

`make build`

`make preview`

`http://localhost:3001`

built output is static site to the [dist](./nhsnotify/dist) folder

For the remote schemas to work NO LONGER WORKS WITH STATIC. IT MUST RUN IN SERVER MODE.
Need to switch to using integrations to enable this ($$$).
